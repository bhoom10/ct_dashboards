# Entrance Test Python-Basic-Programming

## Summary
The Digital Skills Python Basic Programming course is composed around four central concepts:

1. Variables

2. Control Flow

3. Code Organization

4. basic Plotting

This part contains four corresponding tests (notebooks) that collectively cover all these concepts. Students can take these autograded tests, to assess their entrance qualifications. Teachers can decide what and whom this assessment entitles.

File [README](../README.md) explains the details. Also refer to the diagram in there. Observe the suggested entry points for students passing the various parts of the tests.

## Content
The four Notebooks:

- entrance_test_pbp_variables
- entrance_test_pbp_control_flow
- entrance_test_pbp_code_organization
- entrance_test_pbp_basic_plotting

are in increasing difficulty, built upon their qualifications and are therefore to be taken in this order.
