    "\n",
    "We will discuss these below. In the course of your programming efforts, you will see that there are more types. For now, we keep things simple and discuss just the ones above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to assign a value to a variable?\n",
    "After you've typed in a new name for a variable in your code, you *must* also assign it a value. You do this using the *assignment operator* `=` following the variable name, again followed by some value specification. When Python reads the `=` operator in your code, it expects a value to follow. It will ignore spaces and, once read a `=`, it will interpret the first non-space as the start of a value-specification. A value-specification can be a *literal* (such as `1.45` , decimal point, no quotes), or a complete expression that needs to be evaluated first, before its *result* can be assigned to the variable. We come back to this, below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"280\" src=\"./figures/var_assignment.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python you do not need to specify the variable *type* in your code; Python derives the type of the variable itself, from the type of value you assign it. To that end, Python *first* evaluates  the *\"right-hand-side\"*; what is to the right of the assignment operator. Recall that left of the `=` is the variable name, right of the operator is the variable value. The above sketch depicts this mechanism. In this case, with `1.45` being interpreted as a specification of a real number, variable `my_var` will be said to have a value of Python's numeric type for real numbers. To be precise, it is the *value* that set forth the type, the variable itself is merely an identifying name to refer to that value.  As a consequence, in Python, you cannot just create a variable *without* a value. If you really have no clue as to the value to assign to a variable, assign it value `None` (of type `NoneType`), which can be replaced by another type of value, later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to manipulate the variable value?\n",
    "Once a variable has been created and assigned a value, its value can be modified. If the variable is of a *mutable* type, its *existing value is changeable*, and will simply be updated to the new value. Done. To change an *immutable* type, Python operates a bit different: the *existing value* cannot be updated to the new value. Rather, the new value is preserved in memory, the variable name is disconnected from the old value, and then reconnected to this newly preserved value. We also call this *reassignment*. The new value is not necessarily of the same type; the type is redetermined from the new value. The old value goes to waste after a while. It may seen complicated to you, but its operation is usually straightforward. Later on, we will come back to this important aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know types are mutable or not? You have to know or look up. To help you out: of the variable types we will be discussing in this notebook, only `list` is mutable, the rest is immutable (yes, also numeric types `int`, `float`, and also strings type `str`). Until we will discuss *functions* we lay this topic aside. Let's focus again on whole numbers and real number values (first row in the above table). Although immutable, using numeric operators such as `+` (addition), like in:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_var = my_var + 1\n",
    "``` \n",
    "is just as you would expect; the existing value is replaced by the result of the right-hand-side operation. In the above example, we can almost spell out what happens in the right-hand-side evaluation: we read the current value of `my_var`, add `1` to it, giving us the new value to store in memory. The assignment operator finally reassigns the result of the right-hand-side to `my_var`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it yourself, using the below program, in the next cell): \n",
    "\n",

Rather than by mathematical operations (as with numeric variables), boolean variables are manipulated by *boolean operations*. Like in: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "docking_cleared = not docking\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, Python will evaluate evaluate the right hand side `not docking`, and determine that `docking` has value `False`, so `docking_cleared` is assigned boolean value `True`. Had `docking` had value `True`, `docking_released` would have been assigned value `False`; Boolean operator `not` *negates*. For Boolean variables, which can have only two values, negating implies: flipping `True` to `False`, vice verse. The `and` operator evaluates to `True` if both its left hand side and the right hand side evaluate to `True`. In the above example: `ready_for_take_off = engines_on and docking_cleared`, only if both `engines_on` and `docking_cleared` are `True`, we are ready for take off. Finally, Boolean operator `or` evaluates to `True` if either its left hand side or its right hand side evaluates to `True`, or both, and evaluates to `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like mathematical operators, boolean operators have a precedence, a priority of evaluation. In this case: `not` has priority over `and`, so with `docking = False` and `engines_on = True`, `not docking and engines_on` evaluates to: `True` and `True` and therefore to `True`, because `not docking` is evaluated first, before its result in used in the evaluation of `True and engines_on`. You can influence the effect of boolean operators using parentheses (like with numeric operations)."

Ordering implies: a list `[3, 1, 2]` is a different list from `[1, 2, 3]`. In this example, all items are integers. A list of *items of the same type* is also called an *Array*. A list may also have heterogeneous values: `my_other_list = [-1, 'abc', False]` has three item values (in short: 'items'), reps. an integer, a string and a Boolean. List are mutable types, and assignment: `my_list[0] = 100` could be used to set the first *item* in the list to value 100, leaving all other items untouched.\n",

    "Like sequence type `list`, `tuple` is intended to group together several values that can be assigned to a single variable. But whereas a list is a mutable type, a tuple is *immutable*, making it well-suited for items that are not meant to be changed (all the time). You will see them widely around in Python modules, to specify items composed of multiple values. For instance: Assume points in a plane. We might want to represent the origin $P=(0,0)$, by `origin = (0.0, 0.0)`. A striking difference with lists is that *any sequence of numbers, separated by a comma* is interpreted as a tuple, unless surrounded by quotes (in which case it will be interpreted as a string), or by `[`, `]` (in which case it is a list). To illustrate: `tpl1 = (0, 1, 2)` and `tpl2 = 0, 1, 2` will yield exactly the same tuple, whereas `tpl3 = [0, 1, 2]` will be no tuple but a list.\n",

As an illustration: `range(10)` is the same range as: `range(0,10)` is the same range as `range(0,10,1)`. Verify that, indeed, the default values are being used for the `start` and the `step` values. Further example uses of `range()`, and the resulting range they specify, are given in the below table. Notice that `stop` may be smaller than `start` and `step` may be negative.\n",

In this example program, it is `x` that is successively assigned the value of the`range(10)` expansion, being: `x = 0`, `x=1` etc. until the last one: `x=9`. A soon as `x=10`, the range is depleted and the loop terminates. We will come back to this in one of the next notebooks. \n",
