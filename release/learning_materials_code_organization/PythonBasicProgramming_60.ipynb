    "## Indentation\n",
    "In programming, you often need to group source code lines together in what is usually called a *block*, in a loop for instance. See the below code example. Below `a` and `b` are two integers, `a` greater than `b`;\n",

    "    b += 1    # increment b by 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "but not the `print()`? Well you can guess that this is due to the indentation. Indeed it is. Python *reads* structure from the indentation. In other words; in Python, indentation *matters*. The result of the above program is: `a` equal to 14, `b` equal to 12. If you remove the indentation spaces in front of `b += 1`, the result will be `a` equal to 12, `b` equal to 11. This does not to an error, because it is the last line of the indented block. Were you to remove the space in front of `a -= 1`, then what results is:\n",

    "#### Remarks\n",
    "Indentation in Python is pretty straightforward, but there are a few *must knows*;\n",
    "- Python does not prescribed *how much* you indent, just that *within a single block*, all indentations are the same\n",
    "- there is no need for blocks to all have exactly the same indentation. The width of the indentation of one block may be 1 space, while others are 40 space, *as long as it is consistent within a single block*\n",
    "- indentation only has significance for *leading* indentation; indentation with which your code line starts and which extends until the first non-whitespace character or token\n",
    "- Python uses whitespace for indentation, which is a combination of TABs and spaces. Python3 is more restrictive than Python2; we recommend to use only spaces (see below, how editors can be tweaked to do so for you)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most *Python(-aware) editors* are very helpful in this respect;\n",
    "* Python-syntax aware editors jump already to the correct level of indentation, if needed, and  conventionally indent by 4 space, no tabs\n",
    "* even when you use the TAB key to move right to indent, editors tend to replace the TAB-characters by 4 spaces\n",
    "* in a Python editor, if you want to increase or decrease indentation, select the lines to move and press TAB to increase, and Shift+TAB to decrease indentation\n",
    "* even when copy-pasting, some editors may themselves correct or signal any inconsistencies in indentation white space. However, be aware that not every editor does this and changing editors, may result in unexpected behavior. The indentation within a single block must be composed exactly the same way; you must not have a TAB character in one line and only spaces in the next. Even if your code lines seemingly line up perfectly, you may have to redo the indentation to get rid of a persisting `IndentationError`. Such difficulties appear often when you copy-paste code lines (Python2? Python3?) and/or mix the use of different editors on the same program\n",
    "\n",
    "With the below code (a slightly modified version of the above):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DO THIS\n",
    "1. run the program with *initial values* for `a` and `b`;\n",
    "  - `a` smaller than `b`\n",
    "  - `a` equal to `b`\n",
    "  - `a` greater than `b`\n",
    "  and check the output of the equalization process\n",
    "2. select all of the code lines within a single block. Then press TAB a few times. Rerun the program and see is you get an error. Is this what you expected?\n",
    "3. select all the code lines in another block and hit the TAB once. Rerun the program and verify the result\n",
    "4. select all lines in a third block. *detab* (i.e, press Shift+TAB) until there is no indentation left. Unselect the lines and put a single space before each line, so that the resulting indentation is just 1 space. Rerun the program\n",
    "5. put the cursor immediately after a colon ':' and press Enter. The editor will jump to the next indentation level. That is the default indentation width (most likely: 4 spaces). ALign all blocks again to that indentation width. Rerun the program and verify there are no indentation problems left"

    "#### Indentation and long code lines\n",
    "Sooner or later, your code line takes up more than 80 characters; a long `print()` for instance. How to fix this? Do this: use the escape character `\\` *as the **last character** on your long line* and then continue on the next line. The escape character undoes the end-of-line line break and as a result, Python *sees* your multiple line parts as one long line. A line break `\\n` is a non-printable character, and that's why you won't see it. You can use this code line extension multiple times for a single long line. For the continuation on the next line, *indentation rules do not apply* (after all, it is note the leading indentation). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even *without* an escape character, Python may interpret that you spreading your code line across multiple physical lines in your program, depending on *how* you spread it. When you have begun a tuple, a list, a series of items to print, a function parameter list, and a couple of other occasions, Python even without a `\\` understands that it has to merge a number of physical lines in your program to complete the current code construct (actually, it just skips any whitespace characters and line breaks until it sees the closure of the current construct). We will soon see an example below. In all instances, you can enforce continuation of the current code line on a next physical line using the `\\`. In some occasions, wrapping multiple parts on multiple lines by parentheses `(` and `)` also works.\n",

    "3. move the **first** line in the `print()` construct (the line that starts with `print()`) to the right and rerun. Do indentation rules apply here?\n",
    "4. next, in the assignment of the `target_point_coord`, move `(2088283, 7847832)` to a newly inserted line, and rerun. You will see a `SyntaxError`. Indent it and rerun. Does this remove the error?\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "Your program grows and grows, you find yourself repeating the same piece of code, and you decide it's time to create a function. Using a function, you define the code in one place, and call that function to duty whenever and as often as needed to. When you need to change something to the code, without a function, we have to apply changes everywhere where the code has been copied. With a function, you do it only once; within the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a well demarcated chunks of code that can handle some computational task in a generic way. Examples: `math.sqrt()` and `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`. These functions can be used, *after importing them*. All you need to know for function usage, is what the function returns, and which *parameters* or *arguments* (*input variables* that appear in the top line of the function implementation) you have to hand over to the function for your case. For imported functions, you would look these details up in the documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But we can also create functions ourselves; it is an ordinary part of the Python syntax. We may do this in our own programs in our notebook, we might also store functions outside our Notebook, that we ourselves import, like we do with for instance `math`. There is really no difference between functions you find in modules and those in your own code. In this notebook, we keep things simple and define only functions within the notebook itself. \n",

    "In the above diagram;\n",
    "* we have set apart a block of code lines in a function `my_func()`, that does a specific task for us; for instance, it computes an angle\n",
    "* the *calling program*, which *uses* `my_func()`, at several places in the code (we see only a fragment of the code in the diagram), and `my_func()` can compute and return this angle. In the function `my_func()`, the computed angle is named `rho`, in the function caller (our program), the returned value will be assigned to angle `phi`\n",
    "* in order to do its computations, function `my_func()` needs two input values that it assigns to parameters `a` and `b`. Furthermore, let us assume for the sake of this example, that `my_func()` can compute and return an angle $\\rho \\in [0..2\\pi)$ (positive only), or using `sin()` and `cos()` rules, on domain $(-\\frac{1}{2}\\pi, \\frac{1}{2}\\pi]$. For positive only, you need to set `Flag` to `True`. This is what is reflected in the top line of the function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(a, b, flag):\n",
    "```\n",
    "* the call to this function in our program looks like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "phi = my_func(p, q, True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  Python connects the value of `p` with `a`, `q` with `b` and the value `True` with `flag`. The execution of the program is interrupted, the control flow is routed to `my_func()` and execution of `my_func()` is about to begin. With the values handed over, `my_func()` does its computations. The whole function is going to be executed. Once done, `my_func()` creates a value `rho` holding the requested angle value. Assigning a value returned by a function to a variable, works exactly like assigning a value to a variable like we saw before. The variable name `phi` now becomes connected to the angle value created by `my_func()`, a value that is of type `float` in our diagram. Once the function is done, the control flow returns to the program, which now continues on the next code line, following the function call. This interfacing protocol of caller and function has been depicted in the above diagram.\n",

In a sense, that is (almost) precisely what we do to find the winner! The high score is just the max of all the player standings. We don't use the min in this case, nor do we use the sum, but still,  neglecting these two and use only the max for the high score, we are doing the same thing twice.

    "\n",
    "Yes we can. Copy paste your previous solution above into the below code box, and with this code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DO THIS\n",
    "1. implement a function `find_mms(scores)`. Function name *mms* stands for *minimum, maximum, sum*. Function `find_mms(scores)` is given a list of scores, and returns the minimum in that list, the maximum and the sum. With these we can calculate an end_score and determine a high score. Above function `calc_end_score()`, define a second function:\n",

    "    # ... below, min_s is the min score, max_s the max score ...\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    end_scores.append(end_score)\n",

    "```\n",
    "  run the program and verify that we find Katy's score of 44 again\n",
    "7. final step: how to find the name of the winner? There are various possibilities; we take the easiest way here: once we know the `high_score`, we can find the index of that high score in the list `end_scores`, and use index so found in `player_name` to find the corresponding name, like so:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "#### Remarks\n",
    "- clever generalization of tasks in a function can bring a generic solution for a variety of usages in your program, for any number of players, and any length scores, moreover, for any list or tuple of which we want to find min, max and sum. With these, we can also determine the average\n",
    "- that functions themselves may again be calling functions\n",
    "- that Python can assign a function returned value to a variable, that the type of the value returned determines the type\n",
    "- that Python may also return a tuple. When the tuple has three items, like in `return (mn, mx, sm)`, its items can be assigned directly to three variable in the function caller, like in: `low_score, high_score, sum_score = find_mms(end_scores)`. The first tuple item is assigned to `low_score`, the second tuple item to `high_score`, and the last tuple item to `sum_score`. The function still returns a single tuple, that we immediately split out over three separate variables\n",
    " - the indentation to mark the function body\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local and global variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables you define inside a function, have a *scope* (life cycle) that ceases it the function terminates. This is called a *local scope*. If you try to use such a variable outside the function, Python will complain that it is undefined. On the other hand, any variable defined outside the function is also available inside the function. Using variables as *global variables* inside functions, is not considered a good programming habit. Best refrain from doing this. If you do not return anything from a function, it will effectively return `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "An important type of functions are *predicates*: functions that return either `True` or `False`. Say you want a function that determines whether a given whole number is an even number or not. Then a predicate could be:"
