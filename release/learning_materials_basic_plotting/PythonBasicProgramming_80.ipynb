    " \n",
    " * Control flow (for loops, while loops, conditions, and if-then-else statements)\n",

    "For plotting in combination with Python, we will use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Matplotlib is an integral part of Anaconda, and ready to be used. Matplotlib is itself composed of several plotting modules. We will use [module pyplot](http://queirozf.com/entries/matplotlib-pylab-pyplot-etc-what-s-the-different-between-these), offering a plotting style which is largely comparable to plotting in Matlab. Plotting comes with a lot of options, features and details. In this Notebook, we restrict ourselves to basic plotting of functions in a single variable, like $y=f(x)$.\n",

    "It is not hard to determine that for function $f(x)=\\frac{2}{5}x^2-\\frac{6}{5}x+\\frac{1}{2}$, we have a minimum at $x = \\frac{3}{2}$, with value $f(\\frac{3}{2})= - \\frac{2}{5}$. We want to draw the asymptote $y = -\\frac{2}{5}$ and draw the line $x = \\frac{3}{2}$. How to do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DO THIS\n",
    "1. we start with the asymptote: we have $x \\in [X_{MIN}, X_{MAX}]$. In our program given by `X_MIN` and `X_MAX`. Make an extra X-array `X_asymp = [X_MIN, X_MAX]`. For both these x-coordinates, we have `y = -2/5`, so the corresponding `Y_asymp = [-2/5, -2/5]`. Plot this asymptote in the above code box, in the program you just finished. Just add a second plot line. Plot the asymptote as a black line (`k`), dashed (`--`)\n",
    "2. add a 4-th actual parameter to the `plt.plot()` function that prints your asymptote: `linewidth=1` to make the line thinner than the function line\n",
    "3. next comes the vertical line $x = \\frac{3}{2}$. The X-coordinates are easy: define `X_line = [3/2, 3/2]`, for the Y-coordinates, we can take values from the graph or calculate. We simply take `Y_line = [-5, 50]`. Again, we draw a thin black dashed line. Adapt and rerun the program above\n",
    "4. finally, let us add an annotation to each of the axes. add `plt.xlabel('x')` after all the `plt.plot()` lines, and `plt.ylabel(y='f(x)')`, resp. for the X- and the Y-axis. Rerun the program\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observe from these examples;\n",
    "- that, basically, it takes only 2 lines of code to create a reasonably good quality plot\n",
    "- that data preparation, in the example, is tuned towards plotting; we split Y- and Y-coordinates over two separate lists. Had we had a single list of `(x,y)`-pairs we would  have to split them before plotting. We will see later on how to do this\n",
    "- that Matplotlib itself can lay out your axes system ('automagically') deriving fitting values from the data you deliver\n",
    "- no matter *how* you computed x-coordinates `X` and y-coordinates `Y`, as soon as you can feed two non-empty and equal-length list to the `plt.plot()` command, matplotlib is able to plot these for you \n",
    "- the code line `plt.show()` makes your plot visible. Prepare all elements *before* you call `plt.show()`. Do this only when you you want to see the end result, otherwise all elements pieced together in memory so far, are gone"

    "## Plotting multiple functions in a single graph\n",
    "At some point, you will want to plot *multiple functions* in a single plot. How to do that? Well we can simply add yet another `plt.plot()` with the second function plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DO THIS\n",
    "1. implement a second function $f_2(x) = \\frac{1}{36} (x - \\frac{3}{2})^3 - \\frac{2}{5}$, for $x \\in [-10,10]$. Create a new list `X2` and `Y2` and plot this function along with the function we already have. Plot the function $f_2(x)$ using a blue solid line. Rename `f(x)` to `f_1(x)` and adapt the call to this function\n",
    "2. extend the positive part of the domain to see if the two functions intersect. Change `X_MAX` to 20 and rerun. Do they intersect? Verify it\n",
    "3. since we use the same domain for both functions, there is no need to define an `X2` array; both functions `f_1(x)` and `f_2(x)` can share a single `X` list. Modify the program, so that `X, Y1, Y2` remain\n",
    "4. next, we are going to add a *legend*. After the last `plt.plot()` add: `plt.legend()`. Rerun the program. Matplotlib will complain that it found no labels. Indeed, we have to add a label to each of the `plt.plot()` lines, that will appear in the legend. Do like this: `plt.plot(X, Y, 'r-o', label='f_1(x)')` and similarly for the other plots. Do not label the asymptote and the vertical line. Having done this, rerun the program\n",
    "5. finally, let us assume we are more interested in the positive part of the domain than the negative. How can we instruct `pyplot` to plot only the positive part, without recomputing the data? Do this: use `plt.xlim()` to define the part of the x-axis to use in the plot. *Before* the fist `plt.plot()`, insert a code line `plt.xlim(0, X_MAX)`. Rerun the program\n",
